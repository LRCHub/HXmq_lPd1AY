Tonight I'm ready to strike
Tonight I'm ready for the resurrection
I will be part of this night
I will be ready for elimination
Can you hear the marching men
The breath of death is in the air
You can feel the fear Blood is boiling in my veins
Tonight I'm ready for the execution

All my gods standing by my side
In the fields I'm ready to die

For my soul - for my life
I'll be standing tall - I will survive
For the truth is our way
Even if the price shall be my life

The blades are sharpened and bright
The wind is blowing through the dark of night
In this desperate fight
We are defending our freedom and our rights
Staring death in the face
He is looking in my eyes with pride and grace
Might be taking my life
But my soul will live forever

All my gods standing by my side
In the fields I'm ready to die

For my soul - for my life
I'll be standing tall - I will survive
For the truth is our way
Even if the price shall be my life

For my soul - for my life
IT1 be standing tall - I will survive
For the truth is our way
Even if the price shall be my life

All my gods standing by my side
In the fields I'm ready to die

For my soul - for my life
I'll be standing tall - I will survive
For the truth is our way
Even if the price shall be my life

For my soul - for my life
I'll be standing tall - I will survive
For the truth is our way
Even if the price shall be my life

I'm ready to fight
