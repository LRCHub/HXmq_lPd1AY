You once said,
I'll never walk away,
I'll never sail away

I'll never go
And I was there standing outside your door
Waiting for you to show me how to stay

I've been there before,
Hoping and trying to make things right
But now I don't know

Honey, these arms that won't held you are
Ready to fight
Ready to fight

You once said
I'll never walk away,
I'll never sail away

I'll never go
And I was there, standing outside your door
Waiting for you to show me how to stay!

I've been there before,
Hoping and trying to make things right
(But now I don't know)
But now I don't know

Honey, these arms that won't held you are
Ready to fight,
Honey, these arms that won't held you are
Ready to fight
Ready to fight

Home is everywhere your heart is,
I can be that home if you please
Walk with me, and we'll be gone, dear!

Home is everywhere your heart is,
I can be that home if you please
Walk with me, and we'll be gone, dear!

Honey, these arms that won't held you are
Ready to fight

Yeeee-yeeeeah, ready to fight
Yeeee-yeeeeah, ready to fight
Honey, these arms that won't held you are
Ready to fight.
