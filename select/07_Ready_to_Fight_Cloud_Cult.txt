It's the feel of the water as you're breathing it in
You're food for the fish so you will live again
It's the weight of your lungs when you're getting high
You'd spit it out but you'd really like to see the other side
It's the taste of her sweat when she was pulling you in
Like the mouth full of ocean that you're drowning in
And your bones, and your brains, and your skin
Are not as much yours as you thought they were

It's the ringing in your ears when you were feverish and sick
That's the sound of the other side so you better get used to it
It's the things that you see out of the corner of your eye
Everyone will tell you that it's nothing cause they've all gone blind
It's the feeling like you're falling when you first go to sleep
Like your soul's trying to separate but it can't quite break free
And your bones, and your brains, and your skin
Are not as much yours, as you thought they were

You can't come back again, back again
You can't come back again

It's your life flashing before you when you realize what you had
In retrospect it's beautiful but it's too late to go back
It's the light in the tunnel sucking you through
It's the deep regret of the things you never got to do
It's your last breath, your last luck, the end of the show
It's the spark in your eye when you finally let go
And your bones, and your brains, and your skin
Are not at much yours as you thought they were

You can't come back again, back again
You can't come back again, back again
Please don't let me go under again, under again
Please don't let me go under again, under again
